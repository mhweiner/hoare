# Inspiration & Philosophy

**Hoare** is named after [Sir Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare), whose [Hoare Triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic) formalized how we specify software behavior: pre-condition, execution, and post-condition. This idea underpins what we now think of as unit testing.

After years of building [safety-critical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety-critical_system) and mission-critical software in healthcare, finance, and e-commerce, I’ve come to value simple, readable, and maintainable tests — not just for correctness, but for the design clarity they demand.

Good tests act as clear **specifications**. The `{P} C {Q}` structure mirrors how we reason: _given_, _when_, _then_. Tests should make behavior obvious — not obscure it behind clever abstractions or framework magic.

Modern test tools have grown complex, often compensating for design flaws instead of helping reveal them. **Hoare** aims to reverse that — with a minimal API that helps you focus on your code, not the tool.
