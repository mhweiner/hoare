**Hoare** is a fast, minimalist test runner for TypeScript and JavaScript, with a small, easy-to-learn API that lets you focus on your tests — not your tooling.

It emphasizes speed, clarity, safety, and minimal configuration.

Named after [Sir Tony Hoare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Hoare), the inventor of the [Hoare Triple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic) — a foundational idea in formal reasoning and software correctness.

**🔒 Out-of-the-box Typescript support**
- Written in Typescript. No special configuration needed, and no plugins to install. 
- Works great with [c8](https://github.com/bcoe/c8) for code coverage.
- Handles compilation errors gracefully.

**🛡 Defensive**
- Uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections will cause the test to fail.
- Any spec files without tests, or tests without assertions, result in a failed test.
- Strict and deep equality comparison by default.

**🚀 Fast & Reliable**
- Multi-process parallel test runner. Each test file is run in its own process/runtime for performance and isolation benefits. _Use on a multicore machine for best results._
- Optimized for speed and simplicity.
- Minimal dependencies.

**😀 Easy to Use**
- Very simple [assertion API](docs/api.md). No need to learn a new language/DSL or framework.
- Built-in [powerful diff visualization tool](#visual-diff-tool) and clean, organized output.
- Failed tests are easy to find, grouped at the end of the output.
- Errors or unhandled promise rejections are buffered and grouped under the test file in the output. This helps you know where they came from.
- Clean stack traces with no extra noise.

**✨ Modern Features**
- Async/Await/Promise Support
- Supports declarative and functional programming style
- Great with AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and others.

# Quick Examples

```typescript
import {test} from 'hoare';

// Basic test

function greet(name: string): string {
  return `hello, ${name}`;
}

test('greet()', (assert) => {
  assert.equal(hello('world'), 'hello, world');
});

// Error handling

function throwError(): never {
  throw new Error('oops');
}

test('throwError()', (assert) => {
  assert.throws(() => throwError(), /oops/);
});

// Async test

async function fetchData(): Promise<string> {
  return Promise.resolve('data');
}

test('fetchData()', async (assert) => {
  const data = await fetchData();
  assert.equal(data, 'data');
});
```
